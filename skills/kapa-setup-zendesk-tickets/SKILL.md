# Set up Zendesk tickets

Connects through OAuth, so the user approves it in their browser.

## 1. Create the source

`create_zendesk_tickets_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the id.

## 2. Start the connection

`connect_zendesk_tickets` with the source `id` and the user's `subdomain`, the
first label of their zendesk.com host. For `https://acme.zendesk.com` that is
`acme`.

It returns an `auth_url`. **Open it in the user's browser** and ask them to
approve it there.

## 3. Wait for the user, then check once

The approval happens in the browser, so there is nothing to poll. Ask the user
to tell you when they are done, then call `check_zendesk_tickets_connection`
**once**.

## 4. Configure what it ingests

`configure_zendesk_tickets` with `auth_method` set to `oauth` and the same
`subdomain`. Without the auth method the grant is never attached.

**Always narrow this one.** Ingesting every ticket ever filed makes answers
worse, not better, and support tickets are the largest source most teams have.
Use `ticket_age`, `statuses`, `priorities` and `tags` to keep what is useful,
and `tags_exclude` to drop what is not. Ask the user which tickets represent
answers worth reusing.

## Set PII masking before you ingest

This source carries customer names, email addresses and account details, so
set masking up front. Setting it later works, since `update_source` queues the
already-ingested items to be reprocessed under the new rules, but that spends
quota re-reading everything. Doing it first avoids the second pass.

Call `update_source` with `markdown_pii_config` first, for example
`{"entities": ["EMAIL_ADDRESS", "PERSON", "PHONE_NUMBER"]}`. The available
entities are PHONE_NUMBER, EMAIL_ADDRESS, PERSON, CREDIT_CARD and IBAN_CODE.
Use `allow_list` for strings that look like PII but should stay, such as a
support alias.

Ask the user what should be redacted. Do not assume, and do not skip this
because they did not raise it.

## Worth asking about

Support tickets routinely contain customer names, email addresses and account
details. Ask whether that should be ingested at all before setting this up on
a project that serves external users.

## Notes

The grant belongs to whoever approves it, so only that person can configure the
source afterwards.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
