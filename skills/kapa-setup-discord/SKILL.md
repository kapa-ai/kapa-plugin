description: Set up a Kapa Discord source so a Discord channel's threads are ingested. Use when the user wants Kapa to answer from conversations in their Discord server.

# Set up Discord

No token here: Kapa runs its own Discord app. The user still has to add it to
their server.

## 1. The out-of-band setup

Tell the user to:

1. Add the Kapa Discord bot to their server.
2. Turn on **Developer Mode** in Discord: User Settings, then Advanced.
3. Right click the channel and choose **Copy Channel ID**.

Step 2 is the one people miss: without Developer Mode the Copy Channel ID
option does not appear at all.

Use a **forum channel**. Discord ingestion is thread oriented, so a plain text
channel is not what this is for.

## 2. Create the source

`create_discord_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 3. Check the channel

`validate_discord_channel` with `channel` confirms the Kapa bot can read it.
It answers HTTP 200 even on failure, with a `type` of `error` rather than
`channel`, so read the body rather than the status.

A failure here means the bot is not in the server, or the channel is not a
forum channel. There is no token to be wrong.

`list_discord_users` then shows who is in the channel, which is how to turn
"our support team" into the `support_user_ids` the config takes.

## 4. Configure it

`set_discord_config` with `source_discord` and `channel_id`.

One source covers one channel.

## Getting good answers out of it

- `support_user_ids` marks whose replies count as answers. Ask which people or
  roles are their support team.
- `thread_age` limits how far back to read.

## When it ingests nothing

The Kapa bot is not in the server, or cannot see that channel.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step,
so once the config saves the source is live.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
