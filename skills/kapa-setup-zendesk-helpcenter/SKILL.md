# Set up Zendesk Help Center

Connects through OAuth, so the user approves it in their browser.

## 1. Create the source

`create_zendesk_helpcenter_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the id.

## 2. Start the connection

`connect_zendesk_helpcenter` with the source `id` and the user's `subdomain`,
the first label of their zendesk.com host. For `https://acme.zendesk.com` that
is `acme`.

It returns an `auth_url`. **Open it in the user's browser** and ask them to
approve it there.

## 3. Wait for the user, then check once

The approval happens in the browser, so there is nothing to poll. Ask the user
to tell you when they have approved it, then call
`check_zendesk_helpcenter_connection` **once**. It answers with the connection,
or null if they have not finished.

## 4. Configure what it ingests

`configure_zendesk_helpcenter` with `auth_method` set to `oauth`. Without that
the grant is never attached and the source has no credential.

`url` is the **API root, not the browser URL**. Take the part before `/hc` and
append `/api/v2`, and put the locale in `language_code`. So
`https://acme.zendesk.com/hc/en-us` becomes `url=https://acme.zendesk.com/api/v2`
and `language_code=en-us`. Putting the locale in both doubles it in every
ingested link.

Ask which parts of the help center to read. `include_categories` and
`include_sections` take what the user picks, and leaving both out reads the
whole help center.

## Notes

The grant belongs to whoever approves it, so only that person can configure the
source afterwards.

An "invalid authorization request, no such client" error is a Zendesk-side
configuration problem, not something to retry. Tell the user their Zendesk
account needs the Kapa OAuth client registered.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
