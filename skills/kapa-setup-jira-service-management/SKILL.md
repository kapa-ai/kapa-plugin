# Set up Jira Service Management

## 1. Have the user create an API token

https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.

## 2. Create the source

`create_jira_service_management_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the id.

## 3. Check the credential and list the desks

`validate_jira_service_management` with `base_url`, `username` and `api_token`
answers `{"is_valid": bool}`. Read the message back to the user on a failure:
a bad URL, a bad credential and a permissions problem all answer the same way.

Then `list_jira_service_desks` shows the desks, and `list_jira_request_types`
the request types.

The request types cannot be scoped to one desk and carry no desk id, so names
repeat across desks. Show the whole list rather than matching on a name.

## 4. Configure it

`set_jira_service_management_config` with `source_jira_service_management`,
`base_url`, `username` and `api_token`.

- `base_url` is the site root, such as `https://acme.atlassian.net`.
- `username` is the Atlassian account email the token belongs to.
- `api_token` is their secret. Ask for it, never invent one.

**Say what the age filter does before accepting it.** `request_age` limits how
far back requests are read, and the dashboard's own default is the last month
only. Tell the user the window you are setting and confirm it, rather than
quietly ingesting four weeks of a multi-year desk.

Narrow with `service_desk_ids_include` when the site has desks the user does
not want answered from.

## Set PII masking before you ingest

This source carries customer names, email addresses and account details, so
set masking up front. Setting it later works, since `update_source` queues the
already-ingested items to be reprocessed under the new rules, but that spends
quota re-reading everything. Doing it first avoids the second pass.

Call `update_source` with `markdown_pii_config` first, for example
`{"entities": ["EMAIL_ADDRESS", "PERSON", "PHONE_NUMBER"]}`. The available
entities are PHONE_NUMBER, EMAIL_ADDRESS, PERSON, CREDIT_CARD and IBAN_CODE.
Use `allow_list` for strings that look like PII but should stay, such as a
support alias.

Ask the user what should be redacted. Do not assume, and do not skip this
because they did not raise it.

## Worth asking about

Service desk requests often carry customer names, email addresses and private
internal comments. Ask whether that content should be ingested at all before
setting this up on a project that serves external users.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step,
so once the config saves the source is live.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
