description: Set up a Kapa GitHub issues source so repository issues are ingested. Use when the user wants Kapa to answer from problems and solutions discussed in GitHub issues.

# Set up GitHub issues

## 1. Create the source

`create_github_issues_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 2. Configure it

`set_github_issues_config` with `source_github_issues`, `repo_owner` and
`repo_name`.

`repo_owner` and `repo_name` together make the repository path. For
`github.com/acme/docs`, the owner is `acme` and the name is `docs`.

`personal_access_token` is **required only for a private repository**. Do not
ask for one for a public repo. If you do need it, it is the user's secret: ask,
never invent one, and tell them it needs the `repo` scope.

## Check the repository first

`validate_github_issues_repo` with `repo_owner`, `repo_name` and, for a private repo,
`personal_access_token`. It answers HTTP 200 with `false` when the repo cannot
be reached, so read the body rather than the status.

A false covers all of: the repo does not exist, it is private and the token is
missing, or the token lacks the `repo` scope. Offer those to the user rather
than guessing which.

`list_github_issues_labels` then shows the repository's labels.

## Let the user choose the filters

Show these options and ask. Do not pick for them and do not apply a default
silently: what belongs in a knowledge base differs per team.

- `issue_state`: open, closed, or all. Closed issues carry resolutions, open
  ones carry live problems.
- `issue_age`: how far back to read, or all history.
- `labels`: restrict to specific labels, or leave out for every label.

Say what each does, then set what they asked for.

## What it is good for

Issues answer "has someone hit this before". For "how does this work", use
GitHub files against the docs instead.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
