# Set up GitHub files

Ingests files from a repository. This is the GitHub source to use when the
repo holds documentation.

## 1. Create the source

`create_github_files_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 2. Configure it

`set_github_files_config` with `source_github_files`, `repo_owner`, `repo_name`
and `file_extensions`.

`repo_owner` and `repo_name` together make the repository path. For
`github.com/acme/docs`, the owner is `acme` and the name is `docs`.

`personal_access_token` is **required only for a private repository**. Do not
ask for one for a public repo. If you do need it, it is the user's secret: ask,
never invent one, and tell them it needs the `repo` scope.

`file_extensions` is required, so ask which file types to read. `md` and
`mdx` cover most documentation; source code extensions pull in the code
itself, which some teams want and others do not.

Ask about these too:

- `include_paths`: restrict to a directory, or read the whole repository.
- `ref`: a branch or tag to read, or the default branch.

## When it ingests nothing

A private repo without a token, a `ref` that does not exist, or
`file_extensions` that match no file in the paths you restricted to.

## Check the repository first

`validate_github_files_repo` with `repo_owner`, `repo_name` and, for a private repo,
`personal_access_token`. It answers HTTP 200 with `false` when the repo cannot
be reached, so read the body rather than the status.

A false covers all of: the repo does not exist, it is private and the token is
missing, or the token lacks the `repo` scope. Offer those to the user rather
than guessing which.

`list_github_files_repo_tree` then shows the file tree, so you can show real directories and file types.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
