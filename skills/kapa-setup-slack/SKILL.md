# Set up Slack

## 1. The out-of-band setup, which is where this usually fails

Tell the user to:

1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps and install it to the
   workspace.
2. Copy its **bot token**, which starts `xoxb-`.
3. **Invite the bot into the channel.** A bot that is not a member reads
   nothing, and a private channel requires it.

Step 3 is the one people miss.

## 2. Get the channel id

`channel_id` is the id, not the name. In Slack, open the channel, choose View
channel details, and copy the id at the bottom. It starts with `C`.

## 3. Create the source

`create_slack_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 4. Check the token and the channel

`validate_slack_token` with `bot_token` confirms the token itself.

`validate_slack_channel` with `channel` and `bot_token` confirms the bot can
actually read that channel, which is the step that catches a bot that was
never invited. It answers HTTP 200 even on failure, with a `type` of `error`
rather than `channel`, so read the body rather than the status.

`list_slack_users` then shows who is in the channel, which is how to turn "our
support team" into the `support_user_ids` the config takes.

## 5. Configure it

`set_slack_config` with `source_slack`, `channel_id` and `bot_token`. The token
is the user's secret: ask for it, never invent one.

One source covers one channel, so set up several for several channels.

## Getting good answers out of it

Community threads contain wrong answers as well as right ones.

- `support_user_ids` marks whose replies count as answers. This is how Kapa
  tells a maintainer's answer from a guess, so ask which people are their
  support team.
- `thread_age` limits how far back to read. Old threads often describe versions
  that no longer exist.

## When it ingests nothing

The bot was never invited to the channel. Check that before changing the config.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step,
so once the config saves the source is live.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
