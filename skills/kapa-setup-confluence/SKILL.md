# Set up Confluence

## 1. Have the user create an API token

Tell them to open https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
and create one. The token carries that person's own access, so the source
ingests exactly what they can see. A space missing later usually means their
account cannot read it.

## 2. Create the source

`create_confluence_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 3. Check the credential and list the spaces

`validate_confluence` with `url`, `email` and `api_token` answers whether the
credential can read the site. Do this before saving anything: a wrong token
otherwise shows up as a source that silently ingests nothing.

A false here is most often the `/wiki` suffix rather than a bad token.

Then `list_confluence_spaces` with the same arguments shows what that account
can see. Show the user the real space names and ask which to ingest, rather
than asking them to find space keys themselves.

`list_confluence_pages` takes `space_keys_include` as well, so choose spaces
first: without it, it walks every visible space.

## 4. Configure it

`set_confluence_config` with `source_confluence`, `url`, `email` and
`api_token`.

- `url` is the site base **including `/wiki`**, such as
  `https://acme.atlassian.net/wiki`.
- `email` is the Atlassian account the token belongs to. Ask for it; do not
  guess it from the user's other accounts.
- `api_token` is their secret. Ask for it, never invent one.

Use `list_confluence_spaces` to show the user what the token can see, then
ask which spaces to ingest. `space_keys_include` takes the ones they pick, or
`space_keys_exclude` drops a few from everything. Leaving both out ingests
every visible space, including internal ones.

## When it ingests nothing

The account behind the token cannot see that space. Have the user check their
own Confluence access before changing the config.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step,
so once the config saves the source is live.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
