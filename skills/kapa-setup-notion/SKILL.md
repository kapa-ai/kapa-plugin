description: Set up a Kapa Notion source so a Notion workspace is ingested. Use when the user wants Kapa to answer from their Notion pages or databases.

# Set up Notion

## 1. The out-of-band setup, which is where this usually fails

Tell the user to:

1. Open https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations and create an internal
   integration.
2. Copy its internal integration secret.
3. **Open each page or database Kapa should read and share it with that
   integration**, from the page's own menu.

Step 3 is the one people miss. The token only reaches pages explicitly shared
with the integration, so a valid token with nothing shared ingests nothing and
reports no error.

## 2. Create the source

`create_notion_source` with `project` and `name`. Keep the returned id.

## 3. Check the token and list what it can see

`validate_notion_workspace` with `api_token` confirms the token works.

**A valid token does not mean it can see anything.** Always follow it with
`list_notion_pages` and `list_notion_databases`: they answer with what was
actually shared with the integration. An empty list here means step 3 of the
integration setup was skipped, not that the token is broken.

Both answer with at most 20 results, so pass `title_contains` to search.

Show the user the real page titles and ask which to ingest, rather than asking
them to find page ids themselves.

## 4. Configure it

`set_notion_config` with `source_notion` and `api_token`. The token is the
user's secret: ask for it, never invent one.

Ask whether to take everything the integration can see, or to narrow it:

- `page_ids_include` takes single pages.
- `page_ids_include_with_children` takes a page **and everything nested under
  it**, which is what to use for a section of a wiki.
- `database_ids_include` takes databases. A database brings in the pages
  connected to it.

A Notion page id is the last part of its URL: the 32 hex characters after the
title.

## When it ingests nothing

The integration has no pages shared with it. Send the user back to step 3
rather than changing the config: the token is fine.

## Finish the job

Saving the configuration starts ingestion. There is no separate publish step,
so once the config saves the source is live.

Then call `list_sources` with `project_id` to confirm what the project holds.
